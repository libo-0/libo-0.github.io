Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.  --Martin Fowler

## 原则

* Write short units of code: limit the length of methods and constructors
* Write simple units of code: limit the number of branch points per method
* Write code once, rather than risk copying buggy code
* Keep unit interfaces small than risk copying buggy code
* Separate concern to avoid building large classes
* Couple architecture components loosely
* Balance the number and size of top-level components in your code
* Keep your codebase as small as possible
* Automate tests for your codebase
* Write clean code, avoiding "code smells" that indicate deeper problems
